## Direct Resize

A plugin to apply highslide image expansion to MODx Revolution.

[Highslide](http://highslide.com) is a javascript image with several nice features, expand to fit the window, side captions etc.

Please feel free to suggest ideas/improvements/bugs.

## Installation

You could clone the Git repo and install manually but there are several plugin properties that need to be defined. So until I sort out the build scripts the best way is probably to just download the latest transport package.

Place the zip file in the core/packages area and then via the Package Management, click 'Add New Package', and select 'Scan from Local'. This will load the local package you just uploaded. Install it, which will setup
the plugin and property values.

By default it will apply highslide resizing to all images under the directory assets/images/
